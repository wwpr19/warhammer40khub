            <h2> Astra Militarum </h2>
            <p>The Astra Militarum, also known as the Imperial Guard in colloquial Low Gothic, is the largest coherent
                fighting force in the galaxy and serves as the Imperium of Man's primary military force and first line
                of defence from the myriad threats which endanger the existence of the Human race in the 41st
                Millennium.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Navis Imperialis</h2>
            <p>While the Astra Militarum (Imperial Guard) represents the Imperium's ground forces, the Navis Imperialis
                is responsible for the fleets of starships that maintain order between the stars and planets in the
                Imperium, for all space and air support provided to the infantry of the Astra Militarum through its
                Aeronautica Imperialis branch, and for transporting those guardsmen across the galaxy to the Imperium's
                myriad warzones.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Adeptus Astartes</h2>
            <p>The Space Marines or Adeptus Astartes are foremost amongst the defenders of Humanity, the greatest of the
                Emperor of Mankind's warriors. They are barely Human at all, but superhuman; having been made superior
                in all respects to a normal man by a harsh regime of genetic modification, psycho-conditioning and
                rigorous training.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Adeptus Mechanicus</h2>
            <p>The tech-adepts of the Mechanicus are the primary keepers of what is viewed as sacred wisdom, a
                privileged caste of Tech-priests who jealously guard the knowledge required to maintain and construct
                much of the Imperium's advanced technology.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Collegia Titanica</h2>
            <p>The Collegia Titanica is the division of the ancient Mechanicum and the current Adeptus Mechanicus that
                operates and oversees the Titans, the colossal combat walkers that are the most powerful engines of war
                in the Imperium of Man.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Militarum Tempestus</h2>
            <p>The Militarum Tempestus, also known as the Ordo Tempestus, is amongst the most rigidly codified of all
                Imperial organisations, for its troops form the elite backbone of the Astra Militarum, serving as its
                special operations units.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Questor Imperialis</h2>
            <p>The Imperial Knights, or Questor Imperialis in High Gothic, are piloted robotic combat walkers of small
                to medium size in the service of the Imperium and sometimes the Adeptus Mechanicus.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Legio Cybernetica</h2>
            <p>The Legio Cybernetica is one of the oldest sub-branches of the Adeptus Mechanicus and is responsible for
                deploying fully autonomous Battle-Automata for both combat duties and support tasks intended to aid
                Imperial armed forces in the field.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Adepta Sororitas</h2>
            <p>The Adepta Sororitas, colloquially called the "Sisterhood," whose military arm is also known as the
                Sisters of Battle and formerly as the Daughters of the Emperor, are an all-female division of the
                Imperium of Man's state church known as the Ecclesiarchy or, more formally, as the Adeptus Ministorum.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Adeptus Custodes</h2>
            <p> The Adeptus Custodes, known as the Legio Custodes are the Imperial adepta responsible for protecting the
                Imperial Palace and the physical body of the Emperor of Mankind, as well as serving as His most
                important emissaries, His companions, and the keepers of His many secrets. The Custodes is an elite
                cadre of genetically-engineered transhuman male and female warriors who are even more potent in combat
                than the Adeptus Astartes.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Adeptus Arbites</h2>

                Imperium of Man, responsible for enforcing Imperial Law (the Lex Imperialis) on all Imperial-controlled
                worlds. The Adeptus Arbites have been granted the right by the High Lords of Terra to serve as judge,
                jury and executioner for any Imperial citizen they discover having broken Imperial Law.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Sisters of Silence</h2>
            <p>The Sisters of Silence were once the militant arm of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica and were referred to
                internally within the records of the Adeptus Terra as the Departmento Investigates. They are an
                all-female order of Imperial Witch Hunters and soulless psychic Nulls tasked with hunting down renegade
                psykers and other psychic threats across the galaxy. They also help to enforce the Imperium's rigid laws
                on the use of psychic powers.
